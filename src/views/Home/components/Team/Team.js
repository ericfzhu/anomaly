    about:
      'Yee is a pure mathematics graduate currently working in the actuarial and analytics space. Through this project, she hopes to leverage her supervisorsâ€™ subject matter expertise in engineering to broadly understand typical means of processing time series informed by context and practicality, rather than pure theory. She would like to use her understanding of the mathematical mechanisms underlying specific processing methods to tweak processes to be more applicable and robust in practice. She also wishes to brainstorm ways in which existing novel time series models could be used detect anomalous behaviour in time series.',
